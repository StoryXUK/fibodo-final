            <p>4.1 Our Site provides a platform for activity providers (Hosts) to list and sell their services (Host
              Services) and for individuals, corporates, groups or families (Users) to book and pay for these services.
              Any agreement for the Host Services is between the Host and User only. We do not offer any services,
              including any Host Services, apart from the use of the site. Our service to you is the provision of access
              to the Site, any related customer support in relation to the Site, and to facilitate the booking and
              payment of Host Services only. Users and Hosts acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for
              providing the Host Services.</p>
            <p>4.2 Hosts are required to register with the Site in order to utilise our services. These Terms of Use shall apply to Hosts and a separate set of terms of use apply to Users.</p>
            <p>4.3 In addition to receiving bookings and payments for Host Services, our Site provides three different subscription models as set out on the fibodo website, which provide Hosts with a customised level of functionality to suit their specific needs.</p>
            <p>4.4 Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Use, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable licence to use the Site for your business purposes (insofar as they relate to the Host Services) and only in accordance with these Terms of Use.</p>
            <p>4.5 You agree that we may suspend access to the Site or close the Site indefinitely without notice.</p>
            <p>4.6 We make no attempt to, and you agree that we have no responsibility to, confirm the identities of Users of the Site.</p>
            <p>4.7 We reserve that right (in our sole discretion) to limit the number of Host Services or sessions that a Host can post at any time.</p>
            <p>4.8 You agree that you will not use the Site for any purpose other than advertising and selling your Host Services, and related administration and client management.</p>
            <p>4.9 Every host warrants that it has the necessary licences in place for the use of any commercial music used in their broadcasts. The host indemnifies fibodo against 3rd party claims for music copyright infringement on its broadcasts.</p>

            <p>6.1 At all times when using our Site, we recommend exercising caution, particularly when messaging and meeting Users.</p>
            <p>6.2 We maintain a feedback system on the Site (currently operated by the third party provider Trustpilot) which allows Users to give feedback about Hosts.

            <p>7.2 If a Host purchases a subscription package then this will automatically renew on a monthly basis until the Host notifies us of its intent to terminate such subscription, such termination to take effect immediately.</p>
            <p>7.3 The Host shall be entitled to upgrade its subscription payment at any time, subject to the payment of any additional upgrade fees.

            <p>7.6 Hosts agree that we may remove from the Site any Host Services that you list at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>7.7 We reserve the right to refuse access to the Site to anyone at our sole discretion without giving a reason.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>8. Booking Host Services</h3>
            <p>8.1 Once Host Services have been posted, the applicable Host will receive notification once a User requests such Host Services. We will notify the User on screen and/or by push notification via text or email (provided that a valid email address is supplied) confirming the booking request for the Host Services. This represents a confirmation that the Host Services have been booked (a Booking Confirmation).</p>
            <p>8.2 At the point a User receives the Booking Confirmation, payment will be taken from the User.</p>
            

          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>9. Prices and Payment</h3>
            <p>9.1 We may change the user payment methods that we accept at our sole discretion at any time without notice.</p>
            <p>9.2 Host Services may be made available at either standard or discounted rates, as specified on the Site, when listing a Host Service, provided that the rates specified in clauses 9.2.1 and 9.2.2 are not inconsistent with the fibodo payment administration guidelines set out at Schedule 1 and/or the Site:</p>
            <p>9.2.1 Package Rates : Package bookings may be discounted as set out on the Site when listing the Host Services(s). Package rates will only be offered where expressly selected when listing a Host Service. For example, if a package of Host Services is offered then rates may be expressed as "X for the price of Y"(e.g. "4 for 3") meaning that the package is priced below the cost of X number of Host Services if booked individually.</p>
            <p>9.2.2 Discounted services : Discounted rates will only be offered where expressly selected when listing the Host Services. For example, discounted rates may be offered where a User books a Host Service at short notice prior to the relevant Host Service. Host Services may be discounted as set out on the Site when listing the Host Service.</p>
            <p>9.2.3 Standard : Standard rates will apply where Package or Discounted rates are not expressly listed.</p>
            <p>9.3 If a booking is made directly with a User (Direct booking), the Host must clearly inform the user that the booking is made outside of the remit of fibodo and that all requests for refunds or other administration must be handled directly by the Host.</p>
            <p>9.4 Prices stated on our Site shall be inclusive of our commission which, for the avoidance of doubt, is deemed to be paid by the Host to us and not by the User to us.</p>
            <p>9.5 Hosts agrees not to market Host Services, or any services substantially similar to the Host Services, on any third party booking management platform other than fibodo.</p>
            <p>9.6 Hosts may agree to accept introductions of new Users from booking hub partners operating on the Site. In this case, Hosts understand that fibodo will share the spare availability of sessions within its ‘Booking Hub' network of partners. Bookings made through these channels will be subject to increased commissions, according to the commissions set by each Booking Hub partner, and it is the Host's responsibility when creating its products to clearly identify the level of commission amounts (identified by a sliding scale) which the Host is prepared to accept for Booking Hub partner introductions. Prices stated on our Site shall be inclusive of the booking hub partner commissions which, for the avoidance of doubt, are deemed to be paid by the Host to us and not by the User to us.</p>
            <p>9.7 Host agrees that it shall comply with the fibodo special offer guidelines set out a Schedule 1 and agrees that it shall not offer any special offers, discounted rates, loyalty programmes or any other form of reduced or preferential pricing to Users that is inconsistent with that Schedule.</p>
            <p>9.8 Hosts agree to the following payment terms (further details are set out in Schedule 1):</p>
            <p>9.8.1 Hosts agree that we will receive payment for Host Services from the User on a host's behalf and that we will subtract our commission/our affiliate commission and any third party payment service provider fees from such fees before forwarding payment to the Host within seven (7) working days of the Host services having been completed satisfactorily.</p>
            <p>9.8.2 Hosts agree that receipt by us of the correct payment from a User shall fully discharge that User's payment obligation to a Host in respect of the applicable Host Service.</p>
            <p>9.8.3 In the case of Package Rates, we will forward the single payment made to us by Users (less our commission / our affiliate commission and any third party payment provider fees) to Hosts within seven (7) working days of the first Host Service having been completed satisfactorily and Hosts agree that fibodo has no responsibility for any dispute which might arise between the Host and the User subsequently.</p>
            <p>9.8.4 Payment may be refunded to Users pursuant to Clause 10 below.</p>
            <p>9.8.5 We reserve the right (in our sole discretion) not to make payment to Hosts where a User has made a legitimate complaint in relation to the quality of the Host Services or the Host.</p>
            <p>9.8.6 Use of the Site to list and/or contract for Host Services is subject to our commission / our affiliate commission, which we may change at our sole discretion. All our fees are quoted exclusive of any applicable taxes, duties or charges.</p>
